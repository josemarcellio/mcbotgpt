# mcbotgpt

I can't push to GitHub using Visual Studio Code, so I upload this manually.

Change `dotenv` to `.env` and modify all the settings in the `.env` file.

**Required:**
- mineflayer
- dotenv
- axios
- openai key

**How to Run:**
```
node index.js
```
**How to interact with the bot?**

To interact with the bot, simply mention the bot name that you have set in the .env file.
Example:
```
- Hello, what is your name? [bot name]
- Hello, [bot name], who is the president of Indonesia?
```
